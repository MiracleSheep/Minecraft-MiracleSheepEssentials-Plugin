# Minecraft-MiracleSheepEssentials-Plugin

# Description

> This is a plugin that I have already coded and am uploading to github.  
It was my first plugin and I am proud of how it turned out. This plugin was hard coded specifically for my own minecraft server, running paper 1.16.4, so although it will work on other servers, the commands are not configurable and only say what I have told them to say.

### Update as of January 18, 2021

> I have decided to begin updating and revamping this project. It will involve many changes to the code
