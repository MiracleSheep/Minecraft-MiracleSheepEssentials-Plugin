# Minecraft-MiracleSheepEssentials-Plugin

# Description

> This is a plugin that I have already started coding and am uploading to github.  
It was my first plugin and I am proud of how it turned out. This plugin was hard coded specifically for my own minecraft server, running paper 1.16.4, so although it will work on other servers, the commands are not configurable and only say what I have told them to say.

> UPDATE: This plugin has been updated many times, and is no longer hardcoded for my own minecraft server. It is easily custmizable using the config.yml. Many features have also been added.


# What this plugin does

* Adds a /rules command that can be turned on and off in the config and has a customizable message in the config as well.
* Gives you a hospital bill upon death, to allow you to keep a record of how many times you have died. This feature can be turned on and off in the config
  * The lore of the hospital bill and death message can be customizable as well
* Adds a customizable join message shown to the player upon joining, allows this to be turned on or off
* Allows the plugin announcing itself to be turned on or off
* Adds a boomrod command, which can be turned on or off
* Adds a save inventory feature, which works with target selectors, thanks to a plugin called PseudoCommands.
* Plus many more small customizable features in the config.
