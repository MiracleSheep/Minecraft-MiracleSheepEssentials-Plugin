# Minecraft-MiracleSheepEssentials-Plugin

# Description

> This is a plugin that I have already coded and am uploading to github.  
It was my first plugin and I am proud of how it turned out. This plugin was hard coded specifically for my own minecraft server, running paper 1.16.4, so although it will work on other servers, the commands are not configurable and only say what I have told them to say.

# What this plugin does

* Adds a /rules command with a hardcoded non configurable message that lists the rules of my minecraft server
* Gives you a hospital bill upon death, to allow you to keep a record of how many times you have died.

# Plans for updating:

1. Adding a custom weapon called a boom stick, all it is is a blaze rod with extreme damage for use by admin rank or above.
2. Making the plugin fully customizable and able to be used on other servers, for example:
  * Adding a config file, to be used to customize various command like /rules or other future rules
  * Allowing various features to be turned on or off, for example the hospital bill feature
3. Finally, implementing a save inventory feature, that allows you to save multiple inventories for each player by just typing in commands
4. I was thinking of adding kits to the game, but I currently have another plugin in the works that is doing that, and it is in the final stages of bug fixing.
